GETTING STARTED:

The purpose of the Visualization is to have a favorites page with websites to navigate to using the remote that would be frequently visited
like Google, Gmail, Facebook, and possibly more. There is also a pop-up window with instructions on how to use the remote, what voice commands
are avaialble, and how to do voluem control with pose recognition. 


This code was written in HTML and CSS. There are no prerequisites for running this file. 

The pop up was designed on Elfsight, a website that helps create widgets for HTML. This popup is included with a div class and script source that is found online. 

Here is the included graphic on our popup:
