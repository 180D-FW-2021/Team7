GETTING STARTED

Prerequisites:
- OpenCV - library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision
   - In a virtual environment (instructions here: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
   - Run 'pip install opencv-python' for the built-in python extensions
   - Download instructions can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/ 
- MediaPipe
  - This script runs using MediaPipe, which is machine-learning based solution for pose recognition and tracking
  - Install where OpenCV is installed (in virtual environment for example)
  - run 'pip install mediapipe'
