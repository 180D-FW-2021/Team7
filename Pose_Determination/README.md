GETTING STARTED

Prerequisites:
- OpenCV - library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision
   - In a virtual environment (instructions here: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
   - Run 'pip install opencv-python' for the built-in python extensions
   - Download instructions can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/ 
- MediaPipe (https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) 
  - This script runs using MediaPipe, which is machine-learning based solution for pose recognition and tracking
  - Install where OpenCV is installed (in virtual environment for example)
  - run 'pip install mediapipe'
  - Note: in Mac (which is where system is compatible) MacOS version must be 10.15 or higher
  - Other installation instructions and trouble shooting can be found here: https://google.github.io/mediapipe/getting_started/install.html#installing-on-macos
